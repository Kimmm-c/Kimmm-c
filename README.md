### Projects I'm working on:

- I am developing a minimalist painting application called Doodoo using Qt Creator and C++. This app is designed to deepen my understanding of C++ and UI frameworks while also challenging the boundaries of human creativity through its minimalist design and features.

### A little about me:

I graduated from BCIT with a diploma in Computer Systems and am now working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, set to graduate in 2026. My academic journey and co-op placements have exposed me to full-stack development, machine learning, and data structures and algorithms. Over the next couple of years, I'll be diving into wireless and mobile app development and network security.

I'm a tech enthusiast with an entrepreneurial spirit, always eager to learn and grow. Right now, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to work while I take evening classes. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, don't hesitate to reach out to me at kchung0802@gmail.com.
